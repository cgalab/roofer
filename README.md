# roofer

roofer computes the minimum-volume or maximum-volume roof over a given simple polygon.

# Algorithm

The algorithm is based on scientific work that is currently done by my research group.
As soon as the paper that goes along with this program is published, it will be referenced here. 

# Input/Output

Reads wavefront .obj format which should describe a simple polygon. Writes the
same format, optional with 3D coordinates which can be imported to programs like
blender.

# ToDo's
- some TODO's left in the code, the problems are stated along the TODO-comments
- GUI solution has to be rewritten

## Optional ToDo's
- library function

# Requirements 
- C++11 enabled complier (gcc,clang)
- CGAL
- Linux and Mac OS
- GUI only under Linux for now

# License
roofer is written in C++ and uses CGAL.  It computes straight skeleton roofs
as well as minimum- and maximum-volume roofs over a simple polygon.
