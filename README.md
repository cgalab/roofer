# Min/Max Roofs

roofer computes the minimum-volume or maximum-volume roof over a given polygon.

# Algorithm

The algorithm is based on scientific work that is currently done by my group.
As soon as the paper is published, it will be referenced here. 

# Input/Output

Reads wavefront .obj format that should describe a simple polygon. Writes the
same format, optional with 3D coordinates which can be imported to programs like
blender.

# ToDo's
- many TODO's with the essential problem still in the code
- GUI is solved very poorly 

## Optional ToDo's
- libraray funciton

# Requirements 
- C++11 enabled complier (gcc,clang)
- CGAL
